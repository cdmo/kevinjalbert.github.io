    <description type="html">In this post, I present two ways to wrap a shell command and keep its original name. This allows you to run additional statements before and after the execution of a command that you don't own.</description>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wanted to wrap a shell command (that I had no ownership of) so that I could execute additional statements around the original command. In the following sections, I present two scenarios for wrapping shell commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do want to say there is a possibility that the wrapped command &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; potentially cause some issues down the road, however, I have not encountered any as of yet with my limited testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrapping an Executable&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create a new function with the name of the executable that you wish to wrap. This works because the function lookup occurs before the executable lookup on your PATH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# In .zshrc or .bashrc&lt;/span&gt;
ping&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"before"&lt;/span&gt;

  /sbin/ping &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;local &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;exit_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$?&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"after"&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exit_code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function itself uses the original executable (&lt;code&gt;/sbin/ping&lt;/code&gt;) by specifying the full-path along with the original parameters (via &lt;code&gt;$@&lt;/code&gt;). We grab the &lt;em&gt;exit code&lt;/em&gt; (via &lt;code&gt;$?&lt;/code&gt;) and store it to be returned at the ending. This ensures that the new function still operates as it did before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;❯ ping google.com &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt; 1
before
PING google.com &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;172.217.0.238&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;: 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.217.0.238: &lt;span class="nv"&gt;icmp_seq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;0 &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ttl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;115 &lt;span class="nb"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;25.484 ms

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt; google.com ping statistics &lt;span class="nt"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; 25.484/25.484/25.484/0.000 ms
after
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that that the &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt; command still works as expected, but we also now have additional statements around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrapping a Function&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approaches for dealing with a function were mostly borrowed from this &lt;a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/102595/is-there-a-hook-like-system-for-shell/102626#102626"&gt;Unix StackExchange answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Not a function I have defined (i.e., defined in a library I sourced)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;function &lt;/span&gt;example&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"inside example function (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;)"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# In .zshrc or .bashrc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;eval &lt;/span&gt;_&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;declare&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; example&lt;span class="si"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
example&lt;span class="o"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"before function"&lt;/span&gt;

  _example &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$@&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;local &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;exit_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$?&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"after function"&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$exit_code&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt; is essentially renaming the original function (&lt;code&gt;example&lt;/code&gt;) to have a leading underscore (&lt;code&gt;_example)&lt;/code&gt;. A new function is then defined that overrides &lt;code&gt;example&lt;/code&gt;, and actually uses the original&amp;rsquo;s function (now called &lt;code&gt;_example&lt;/code&gt;). You define additional statements before and after the wrapped function, in a similar fashion to how it was handled with wrapping an executable. The exit code is also preserved from the wrapped function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;❯ example 5
before
inside example &lt;span class="k"&gt;function &lt;/span&gt;5
after
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One downside to the above approach is that the &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; function is still present (&lt;code&gt;_example&lt;/code&gt;). While the following only works in ZSH, it is possible to directly override the original function by using the original&amp;rsquo;s definition when creating the new function. To note, I do find the former approach simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight shell"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# .zshrc&lt;/span&gt;
functions[example]&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'
  (){
    echo "before"

    '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$functions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;example]&lt;span class="s1"&gt;';
    } "$@";
  local exit_code=$?

  echo "after"

  return $exit_code'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <description type="html">In 2016, I made a New Year's resolution to blog about something of substance every month. In this post, I'll reflect on this five-year journey.</description>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just over five years ago, I decided to dive into the technical blogging sphere. Since then, I have consistently produced a blog post every month. There are a couple of reasons why I blog and why I wanted to keep the monthly cadence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing Knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving my Writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Presence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last five years, I&amp;rsquo;ve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Published 63 blog posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrote 53,017 words (includes a bit of markup here and there).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created content that would take 263 minutes to read (assuming 180 words per minute).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reached 78,121 people with my writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to reflect on this journey &amp;ndash; goals, challenges, rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Challenges with Blogging&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Time Commitment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my biggest struggle with blogging. I procrastinate until the last possible moment and usually post within the last few days of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time commitment for each blog post varies depending on its content. The technical ones normally require a lot of upfront work (building the project and writing the code), while the non-technical posts are typically shorter to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I try to work on the posts in the evenings, but it sometimes bleeds into the weekend. Having a family makes it a bit challenging, but not impossible as my wife is a rockstar. A post can be &lt;em&gt;chipped away&lt;/em&gt; at instead of just writing the whole thing in one go, which is something I want to do more consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Blogging Platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built my blog using &lt;a href="https://middlemanapp.com/"&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, you can look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/kevinjalbert/kevinjalbert.github.io"&gt;GitHub repository for the website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on, I put a decent amount of work into making the site. It still serves its purpose but isn&amp;rsquo;t aging well. I almost always hit some local development issue when I spin it up as the technology stack/dependencies are old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m torn &amp;ndash; I want a simple platform for writing, but I want customization capabilities. I&amp;rsquo;ll likely move to a new platform in the future, but it&amp;rsquo;s such a daunting task. I&amp;rsquo;ll also plan to investigate using an off-the-shelf solution for blogging. The idea is to spend less time on the platform and more time on creating content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Driving Traffic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting traffic to my website is something I don&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy, and for the most part, I really depend on organic traffic and just the general SEO (Search Engine Optimization) that my website provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point, I decided to add a newsletter (which has just surpassed 100 subscribers). I&amp;rsquo;m currently using &lt;a href="https://mailchimp.com/"&gt;Mailchimp&lt;/a&gt; as it has an option to consume an RSS feed that pushes emails out to subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also done some posting here and there on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. When the subreddit matches the blog post topic it can drive some traffic. I saw this best when I was writing Notion related posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve cross-posted a few times on &lt;a href="https://dev.to/kevinjalbert"&gt;Dev.to&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@kevinjalbert"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, but haven&amp;rsquo;t done so in a while. I&amp;rsquo;m still not 100% sure about the measurable benefits of cross-posting and whether it&amp;rsquo;s worth the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve occasionally promoted my posts on social media. Similar to the above point, do the benefits outweigh the time invested. I have seen some traction when tagging companies or topics to widen the reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Rewards of Blogging&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reaching Many&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following image is a snapshot of the five years in Google Analytics. I take pride that so many people have seen my content. The growth is a nice nod as well in keeping the monthly cadence up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Blog stats" width="1912" height="1318" src="/images/2021-01-30-reflecting-on-five-years-of-monthly-blogging/blog-stats.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Following Referrals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is nice to see &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; my content is reaching, and the following image shows how users are finding my content from a referral perspective. When drilling into specifics, it&amp;rsquo;s rewarding to see one of my blog posts ending up in a &lt;a href="https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot/pull/1134#issue-466028793"&gt;GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7298088/def-block-in-rake-task"&gt;StackOverflow answer&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://tshaped.io/zapier-and-notion/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Blog referrals" width="1958" height="1728" src="/images/2021-01-30-reflecting-on-five-years-of-monthly-blogging/blog-referrals.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ability to Refer to own Posts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times during my work, I am able to refer a colleague to a post of my own. I&amp;rsquo;ve had colleagues mention that they had found my posts when searching for a topic as well. I&amp;rsquo;ve even caught myself stumbling upon my own post when Googling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By writing down some information as a post, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to reiterate it again if it is relevant &amp;ndash; I can simply link to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Future&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see myself continuing with my monthly blog post for the foreseeable future. It&amp;rsquo;s worth my time investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently made posts that have a YouTube video embedded in them. Normally these are for demos from a side project. I&amp;rsquo;ll likely continue these tactics, and experiment how I can incorporate them into a variety of other post topics. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFWPd8rky_tD4B4Qqq99i4Q"&gt;My YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; is very much in its infancy, and the quality of the videos could use some improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Youtube stats" width="1384" height="874" src="/images/2021-01-30-reflecting-on-five-years-of-monthly-blogging/youtube-stats.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the challenges section, I have dabbled in other services and platforms to broadcast my content. I would like to further explore this as it has the potential to drive more traffic to my content and improve the SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current blogging set up is aging, and I would really like to improve it. I plan to look into using a more modern &lt;a href="https://jamstack.org/"&gt;Jamstack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading my content over the past five years. I look forward to creating new content that sparks interest.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Using URL Scheme Links in Notion</title>

    <description type="html">URL Schemes provide powerful ways to integrate applications together in the Apple Ecosystem. Notion, unfortunately, doesn't allow these URL Scheme links, as they are not 'valid' URLs. We can work around this by using a URL shortener to do some redirection.</description>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Context &amp;ndash; the Integrations from Notion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to have the ability to link from &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/?r=6b8d609eb50943419db4d87c67fa558e"&gt;Notion [Referral]&lt;/a&gt; to other applications in the Apple ecosystem (e.g., &lt;a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/"&gt;Things&lt;/a&gt;). If the application itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer the integration, you can usually &lt;em&gt;hack&lt;/em&gt; something together using &lt;em&gt;URL Scheme links&lt;/em&gt; (also called &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/shortcuts/apdcd7f20a6f/ios"&gt;&lt;em&gt;x-callback-url&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), which are defined by an application. For example, Things has an &lt;a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803573/"&gt;excellent article&lt;/a&gt; on how you can use URL Scheme links to interface with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Problem &amp;ndash; the Invalid URL&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Notion doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognize URL Scheme links (e.g., show &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; in Things using &lt;code&gt;things:///show?id=today&lt;/code&gt;) as valid URLs. Even if you try to edit an existing URL in Notion, it won&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has come up as an issue in the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion"&gt;Notion subreddit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/azfnef/urlscheme_plz/"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/gcx4nw/links_to_other_apps_xcallbackurl/"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Solution &amp;ndash; the URL Shortner&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using a URL shortener service (in this case &lt;a href="https://tinyurl.com/"&gt;TinyURL&lt;/a&gt;), we can create valid URLs that Notion will let us use. These URLs will open the browser and the redirection will then trigger the URL Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a full demo of how this all works, you can watch the following short video I recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class="youtube-embed" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cQvTnq9m_gg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the generation of these TinyURLs easier, I created an &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios"&gt;iOS Shortcut&lt;/a&gt; that simplifies it by using the TinyURL&amp;rsquo;s API. You can grab the shortcut &lt;a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ab01776c15a442938fe18f1e5f786586"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or just recreate it yourself using the following template:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="display: flex"&gt;
  &lt;img src="/images/2020-12-22-using-url-scheme-links-in-notion/shortcut.jpeg" style="width: 49%; height: 100%"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Future &amp;ndash; the Endless Possibilities&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do hope that Notion eventually &lt;em&gt;allows&lt;/em&gt; for URL Scheme links to be used without any URL redirection needed. For the time being, however, this workaround does the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With iOS Shortcuts, there are countless possibilities available to you. You can initiate &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; from a URL link in Notion now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine using this technique in Notion databases &amp;ndash; having a URL column that does something on your device when you open it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a crude integration starting from Notion leading into another iOS Applications is entirely doable, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Things to specific project pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link to an external artifact (e.g., Email from &lt;a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/"&gt;Spark&lt;/a&gt;, Note from &lt;a href="https://bear.app/"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;, etc&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="/daily-review-using-ios-shortcuts-and-scriptable"&gt;Shortcut that kicks off a daily review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Shortcut that fires off an HTTP request that triggers an external API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each application provides its own URL Scheme, although this &lt;a href="http://x-callback-url.com/apps/"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; does a decent job cataloging URL Schemes of popular applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibilities are truly endless.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description type="html">Notion has recently released iOS widgets, however, they are limited in functionality. In this article, I present my custom Notion iOS widget that has a unique set of features. This widget is built using iOS Shortcuts, the Scriptable application, and a notion-py server.</description>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The Offical Notion Widget&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/What-s-New-157765353f2c4705bd45474e5ba8b46c#a2dc9af353a746cabaf436fdfaeca4a7"&gt;November 22 of 2020, Notion released their iOS widgets&lt;/a&gt;. This was a great step forward for the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/notion-notes-tasks-wikis/id1232780281"&gt;Notion iOS application&lt;/a&gt; as iOS 14 had just released support for widgets in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They offered the following three widgets (as quoted from their widget descriptions):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page: Get quick access to one of your Notion pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Favorites: Get quick access to your Notion favorites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recents: Get quick access to recently viewed pages in Notion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My Unofficial Notion Widget&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on my own custom Notion iOS widget since October before it was known that official widgets were coming out. I was pleasantly surprised that their widgets haven&amp;rsquo;t made my custom widget obsolete, as the functionality is unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following video provides a demo of my widget in action, as well as explaining a bit about how it was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe class="youtube-embed" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/atq6u7Le1JE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following technologies were used to make this all possible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API server using &lt;a href="https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;notion-py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios"&gt;iOS Shortcuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://scriptable.app/"&gt;Scriptable&lt;/a&gt; iOS application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are more interested in the technicals or would like to set up your own widget, you can look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/kevinjalbert/notion-toolbox/tree/master/ios_widget"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ios_widget&lt;/code&gt; tool&lt;/a&gt; within my &lt;a href="https://github.com/kevinjalbert/notion-toolbox"&gt;&lt;code&gt;notion-toolbox&lt;/code&gt; GitHub Repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that there are plenty of rough edges in this implementation as of its initial release, and it does require a lot of setup investment. In addition, if/when Notion decides to up their widget game, my custom solution might become obsolete. There are also concerns surrounding the upcoming offical Notion API, as I&amp;rsquo;m currently using the unofficial one (which can, in theory, break without notice). I&amp;rsquo;ll be curious how I can adapt my widget to use the official API in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description type="html">Guided Access is a great feature in iOS that limits the device to only show a single application with customizable restrictions. The ease of enabling/disabling a Guided Access session, opens up a lot of easy use cases that you might want to try it.</description>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This will be a short post that serves more as a reminder to iOS users that you have access to the &lt;em&gt;Guided Access&lt;/em&gt; feature. This is a feature that is tucked away under &lt;em&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Accessibility&lt;/em&gt;, although its uses might fall a bit out of the typical realm of &lt;em&gt;accessibility&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What does Guided Access do?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202612"&gt;Apple&amp;rsquo;s Support page&lt;/a&gt; on Guided Access:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guided Access limits your device to a single app and lets you control which features are available. You can turn on Guided Access when you let a child use your device, or when accidental gestures might distract you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main draw is that it allows you to lock down your device by allowing only a single application to run. This means that without the passcode (or your touch/face ID), people cannot navigate away from where you enabled Guided Access. You also have the ability to disable regions of the screen and various device features (e.g., touch, keyboard, buttons, motion). It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that banner notifications no longer show up while in a session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can enter a Guided Access session with a triple-click of the side/home button, and you exit with a double-click (if you have touch/face ID enabled). No need for the passcode if it is you trying to exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Where to use Guided Access?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined some use cases here, but I&amp;rsquo;m certain that there are other creative uses that I&amp;rsquo;m missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When handing your device over&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those with children, this is a great feature to leverage when you hand your child your device. You can lock down the device to the point where you don&amp;rsquo;t have to fear them getting into things they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t. You can also set time limits if needed so that a passcode pops up, ending their fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar capacity to using it with children, this feature is useful when handing your phone to another person to show them something specific on your device. For example, you can enable a session and disable the touch feature so they can only &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; at what you have on the screen. There is also no chance of embarrassment/privacy concerns as banner notifications don&amp;rsquo;t show up when you are in a session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In situations when you are using a device for surveys or as a kiosk to complete forms, Guided Access would work well. As a side note, there is a better way to handle this using the &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/apple-configurator-2/cadbf9c172/mac"&gt;Single App Mode via the Apple Configurator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When gaming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iOS doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;em&gt;gaming mode&lt;/em&gt;, unlike some Android phones. This would be a mode that disables notifications and some touch gestures. Well, Guided Access on iOS is pretty much that without being labelled as such. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/jh8co3/pro_tip_if_you_turn_on_guided_access_gaming_gets"&gt;This Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; does a great job outlining the benefits of gaming in a Guided Access session. TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No accidental swipe gestures opening the notifications or control center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No home bar indicator if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a home button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No redirection if you touch an ad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No accidental &lt;em&gt;Back Tap&lt;/em&gt; (if you have them set up).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change/disable Auto-Lock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to add that you can still get notifications on your Apple Watch even when in a Guided Access session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can automate some of this if you plan to always play certain games in Guided Access by using an iOS Shortcut. You would create an &lt;em&gt;Automation&lt;/em&gt; that, when your game application, would start the Guided Access session automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tl;DR&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guided Access is powerful and quick to enable/disable. It can really help when you have to hand your device over to someone without fearing what they might get into. As mobile devices are nearly full-fledged gaming devices as well, the usage in a gaming scenario can also prove useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know about this iOS feature? Have you used it before, and if so in what capacity?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Daily Review Using iOS Shortcuts and Scriptable</title>

    <description type="html">Read how I orchestrate my daily review that consists of multiple applications using iOS Shortcuts. I create a notification-based workflow as a workaround to Shortcut's time limit when switching between applications.</description>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Doing daily and weekly reviews are generally considered a good habit, as it can help with organizing life and making sure you focus on the important things. Reviews are tailored to the individual and depend a lot on the individual&amp;rsquo;s goals and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My Frustrations Doing Daily Reviews&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing daily reviews for me has raised some frustrations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have several steps in my daily review, which I haven&amp;rsquo;t properly formalized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I sometimes don&amp;rsquo;t have a solid block of time to process each step of my review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like using my laptop that resides in my home office, which has caused me to delay/miss reviews if I cannot make time to get to my laptop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Using my iPhone for Daily Reviews&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon looking at the frustrations, I came up with a better solution that uses my iPhone for my daily reviews. I always have my iPhone near me, and the individual steps of my review use applications that are web-based or within the Apple ecosystem. I&amp;rsquo;m giving up a physical keyboard by using my iPhone, but I&amp;rsquo;m willing to make that trade-off for accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When iOS 12 was released, it came with &lt;em&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/em&gt;. This was a new feature that allowed you to string together a bunch of tasks to create workflows. The Shortcuts functionality is my best bet in creating a formalized process that allows me to work through various applications as part of my daily review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;iOS Shortcuts and its Limitations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My strategy includes a &lt;em&gt;Review&lt;/em&gt; Shortcuts folder that contains the individual steps of my review process. I&amp;rsquo;ll have a single shortcut which then orchestrates my review using all those individual steps. I take advantage of the &lt;code&gt;Wait to return&lt;/code&gt; scripting action, which allows me to interact with an application (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Things&lt;/em&gt;) and then continue to the next step when I return to the Shortcuts application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="display: flex"&gt;
  &lt;img src="/images/2020-09-28-daily-review-using-ios-shortcuts-and-scriptable/review-folder.png" style="width: 33%; height: 100%"/&gt;
  &lt;img src="/images/2020-09-28-daily-review-using-ios-shortcuts-and-scriptable/review-shortcut.png" style="width: 33%; height: 100%"/&gt;
  &lt;img src="/images/2020-09-28-daily-review-using-ios-shortcuts-and-scriptable/things-shortcut.png" style="width: 33%; height: 100%"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked out well when I was creating the workflow, but I hit a limitation in iOS Shortcuts. A running shortcut will only stay active for a short period of time when you are away from the Shortcuts application. From my experience, this is around 3 minutes. This means that if one step of my daily review takes longer than 3 minutes, the whole thing breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Actionable Notifications via Scriptable&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I was a bit disheartened with the time limitation in Shortcuts. I looked around for another solution. Instead of using the &lt;code&gt;Wait to return&lt;/code&gt; scripting action, I could use actionable notifications to open a URL that triggers the shortcut via the &lt;code&gt;shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=shortcutname&lt;/code&gt; URL scheme. Unfortunately, iOS Shortcuts does not have that capability when creating notifications as they can only show text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some searching online and found &lt;a href="https://scriptable.app/"&gt;Scriptable&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful iOS automation application that uses JavaScript. With this, I could create notifications that, when interacted with, could open a specified URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Putting it Together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to explain how I used iOS Shortcuts and Scriptables together to make everything work, as this just got a bit more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Daily Review&lt;/em&gt; shortcut grabs the text of each shortcut of my review process (within the &lt;em&gt;Review&lt;/em&gt; folder) and turns it into a single string separated by commas. This string looks like &lt;code&gt;Things,Journal,Habits,Drafts&lt;/code&gt; and we pass that into a Scriptable action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our individual steps of the review process are still fairly simple shortcuts, although now they take the &lt;em&gt;Shortcut Input&lt;/em&gt; and push that into the same Scriptable action as mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that there are a few other small things happening in these shortcuts, but I&amp;rsquo;ve omitted them for the sake of brevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="display: flex"&gt;
  &lt;img src="/images/2020-09-28-daily-review-using-ios-shortcuts-and-scriptable/revised-review-shortcut.jpeg" style="width: 49%; height: 100%"/&gt;
  &lt;img src="/images/2020-09-28-daily-review-using-ios-shortcuts-and-scriptable/revised-things-shortcut.png" style="width: 49%; height: 100%"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My approach pushes all state of &lt;em&gt;where I am in the review process&lt;/em&gt; into the shortcut input, which is the string of shortcut steps to run. To see how we connect these shortcuts together, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at the Scriptable code that uses that string of shortcut steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre class="highlight javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Variables used by Scriptable.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// These must be at the very top of the file. Do not edit.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// icon-color: deep-green; icon-glyph: user-md;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createNotification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;openURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notification&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Notification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;openURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;openURL&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;notification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;schedule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shortcutParameter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;""&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createNotification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Done after this!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;openURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=Homescreen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shortcuts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shortcutParameter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextShortcut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shortcuts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kd"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;remainingShortcuts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;shortcuts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dl"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;createNotification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`Next step is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;decodeURI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextShortcut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="na"&gt;openURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;`shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;nextShortcut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;amp;input=text&amp;amp;text=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remainingShortcuts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;setShortcutOutput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;remainingShortcuts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;complete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll walk through key steps of what happens when we trigger the &lt;em&gt;Daily Review&lt;/em&gt; shortcut:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab all shortcuts from the &lt;em&gt;Review&lt;/em&gt; folder and combine them into a single string (e.g., &lt;code&gt;Things,Journal,Habits,Drafts&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This string is passed as input to the Scriptable action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The script identifies &lt;code&gt;nextShortcut = &amp;quot;Things&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;remainingShortcuts = &amp;quot;Journal,Habits,Drafts&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A notification is created that has the URL of &lt;code&gt;shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=Things&amp;amp;input=text&amp;amp;text=Journal,Habits,Drafts&lt;/code&gt; that says &amp;ldquo;Next step is Things&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Daily Review&lt;/em&gt; Shortcut has finished running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tapping the notification will run the &lt;code&gt;Things&lt;/code&gt; shortcut and pass in the inputs of &lt;code&gt;Journal,Habits,Drafts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Things application is opened, and the shortcut&amp;rsquo;s input is passed along to the same Scriptable action as before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new notification is created for the next step while removing that step from the string of remaining shortcuts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually all shortcuts are run using steps 6-8, and a &amp;ldquo;Done after this!&amp;rdquo; notification finally shows. This will open the user&amp;rsquo;s homescreen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Daily Review With No Time Limits&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new approach using Scriptable along with Shortcuts, while complicated, allows me to circumvent the time limit of Shortcuts. The workflow is actually pretty nice as I can move along entirely following notifications as the triggers for the next steps. All the state of the whole process is encoded in the string of shortcuts that have to run. The Review folder approach also makes it easy to add a new step in my review process, should the need arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Demo" width="414" height="896" src="/images/2020-09-28-daily-review-using-ios-shortcuts-and-scriptable/demo.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the above gif isn&amp;rsquo;t doing it for you, you can get a better sense of the whole thing by watching the following video I recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description type="html">In this post I revisit the topic of content consumption, adding new criteria to my selection process. I also discuss using a new tool (spoiler...it's Notion) to hold the content.</description>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve previously talked about &lt;a href="/consuming-content-and-managing-the-flood"&gt;managing your content consumption&lt;/a&gt; using metaphors such as a dam, the flow of water, a reservoir, and a spillway. I highly recommend reading through if you are looking for some techniques to tame information overload. In case you don&amp;rsquo;t want to read the above article, the main point is to focus on high-quality sources and don&amp;rsquo;t consume everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert! Even though I wrote the above article, I have to revisit the topic as my metaphorical dam is broken. I&amp;rsquo;m finding myself facing the flood with 300+ articles in the reservoir. In this article, I will revisit content consumption management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;System Check&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a look at my content consumption from a system&amp;rsquo;s perspective. There are four factors at play that determine the backlog of content to consume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pace at which I can consume content from my reservoir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The flow of content from sources making it to my dam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effectiveness of my dam (i.e., the filter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effective removal of content that is no longer valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving the pace at which I can consume content is tricky as it depends a lot on the amount of free time I can devote to it. I decided to focus on the other three factors instead as a way to distil the content down to the most valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reducing the Flow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flow of content from sources making it to my dam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;flow of water&lt;/em&gt; was the analogy I used in my dam metaphor for the rate of content coming in. This is tunable and can be controlled. I had advocated highly for the use of newsletters as they are narrow in focus and are filtered for good calibre pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to keep tabs on where the good pieces of content are coming from. The importance and value of consumed content will change over time based on projects and interests. This means that I can remove specific content sources if they are underdelivering in value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I have done organically (i.e., &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll unsubscribe from this newsletter as I don&amp;rsquo;t care about YYYY much anymore&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;), but I want to put more of an objective system in place. To do this, I want to track the volume and perceived value gain from my content sources. I&amp;rsquo;ll then routinely be able to revisit and see what is feeding into my content consumption pipeline and what is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Effectiveness of Dam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of my dam (i.e., the filter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal of consuming content is to extract information and turn that into knowledge, ultimately being able to use that to produce results. With that in mind, the following are three guiding principles I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to use before committing to consuming a piece of content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the information valuable in the long-term?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritizing long-term knowledge will lead to &lt;a href="https://fs.blog/2019/02/compounding-knowledge/"&gt;compounding knowledge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the information relevant to immediate projects?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short-term knowledge is needed for the current situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the information uniquely valuable?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are diminishing returns from consuming more content on the same topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I want to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge extraction. The first two principles I&amp;rsquo;m carrying over from the previous system of content consumption. The third principle is new and should help improve the effectiveness of my dam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially I want the content to make it through the dam filter if &lt;code&gt;(content is long-term || content is relevant) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; content is unique&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either of the first two principles must be true for the content to be of any value. It is worth noting that having both being true is the best scenario &amp;ndash; the information is relevant and long-term knowledge. The relevancy principle is important to have as I want to make sure that I&amp;rsquo;m not losing short-term gains on the projects and problems I&amp;rsquo;m working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Filtering Examples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of something that would be filtered out is an article on &lt;em&gt;upgrading from Rails 5.x to 6.x&lt;/em&gt;. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t consider this long-term knowledge as eventually, Rails will progress past these versions. There is no relevance for this article based on my current projects, and thus it should be filtered out. If afterwards I now have a project that would have benefited from this information, not all is lost as I would just &lt;em&gt;seek&lt;/em&gt; it, embracing &lt;em&gt;Just In Time&lt;/em&gt; learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example would be pieces of content around &lt;em&gt;empathy in code reviews&lt;/em&gt;. This is great long-term knowledge, as well as relevant to my work. The problem is, I&amp;rsquo;ve already consumed something like this and have extracted and internalized the knowledge. This fails the third principle of being uniquely valuable, and thus I would filter these out. If at a later date, I&amp;rsquo;m doing a presentation or article on empathy in code reviews, I would employ &lt;em&gt;Just In Time&lt;/em&gt; learning to find all relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Effectiveness of Spillway&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effective removal of content that is no longer valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right before consuming a piece of content from the reservoir, I&amp;rsquo;ll revisit the three principles. A piece of content may have lost relevancy, or is no longer going to provide unique value. This is a quick way of removing content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With hopefully a smaller number of content sitting in the reservoir, this mechanism will be enough. In the event that the reservoir is overflowing, you can quickly sweep through everything and reevaluate. The key is to be ruthless, as important information will likely find its way back to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Notion: The New System&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve previously used a mixture of applications to store consumable content. The main application I have used for articles is &lt;a href="https://www.instapaper.com"&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt;. The new system demands more metadata and so I&amp;rsquo;ve made the switch to entirely use &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/?r=6b8d609eb50943419db4d87c67fa558e"&gt;Notion [Referral]&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to use separate applications for podcasts and books, but they&amp;rsquo;ll likely have &lt;em&gt;entries&lt;/em&gt; within Notion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Reservoir&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is in a single database within Notion, these are the following fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A default text field that holds the name of the piece of content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., article, video, podcast, book, twitter thread, etc&amp;hellip;)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A select field that specifies what medium the content resides in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Origin&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., XXXX Newsletter, XXXX Podcast, friend, etc&amp;hellip;)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A select field that specifies how I discovered the piece of content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;URL&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A URL field that holds the link to the content, which in some cases might be blank depending on the content&amp;rsquo;s type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criteria&lt;/strong&gt; (Long-Term, Relevant, and Unique)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A multi-select field that indicates the criterion that holds true for the piece of content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value&lt;/strong&gt; (None, Low, Medium, and High)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A select field that indicates the value gained after consuming the piece of content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Created At&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A timestamp field of when the piece of content was added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These fields address the three principles within the &lt;em&gt;Criteria&lt;/em&gt; field, as well as metadata on how to reduce the flow of content via the &lt;em&gt;Origin&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Value&lt;/em&gt; fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within desktop usage, I make use of the &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-notion/ldmmifpegigmeammaeckplhnjbbpccmm"&gt;Save to Notion&lt;/a&gt; extension as I can fill in more of the metadata from the browser. Within mobile usage, saving content takes another step as I have to go into Notion and add the metadata. For the most part, I try to make use of my desktop when adding content to the Notion database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Iterate and Evolve&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll keep making changes and iterate on my content consumption system, hopefully making it better each time. The goal is still to turn pieces of content into information that I can use as knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing I&amp;rsquo;m planning to tackle is the actual consumption part of the system and having a process for knowledge retention.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description type="html">In this post, I demonstrate how to communicate work meetings to my family while working from home. I use a combination of software and hardware to accomplish an informative and automated solution that provides information about my availability to my family.</description>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this post (still in COVID-19 times), remote working, at least for the short-term, is quite prominent. If I had to guess, remote work will continue to thrive after the COVID-19 pandemic passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve previously written a multi-part series on how to &lt;a href="/improve-your-home-office/"&gt;Improve your Home Office&lt;/a&gt;, and this current post builds on the topic by providing my solution to meeting interruptions by my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Problem: Family Interruptions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My home office is in the basement. During the day, my wife is caring for our two children (3.5 years and 6 months old). She occasionally needs my help for a few minutes here and there. From a timing perspective, I do take breaks, but they might not 100% lineup with when she is seeking assistance/relief. Ideally, she would be able to reach out to me when I&amp;rsquo;m not busy (or in a meeting) and I can come up from my office for a few minutes to help out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed a way to communicate my meeting schedule so that my wife could see when I&amp;rsquo;m not available to help. This is going to be more important as my children get older, as they will more likely want to come into my office while I&amp;rsquo;m working. It is worth mentioning that I have a door to my office that I keep closed during the workday &amp;ndash; it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t communicate my availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Solution: Wall-Mounted Tablet Showing Google Calendar&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an old &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/32Pn3Wy"&gt;Fire 7 Tablet from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; that I attached to the wall with two &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2D4SzEM"&gt;Command Picture Hanging Strips&lt;/a&gt; and powered via a long Micro-B USB cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that the tablet screen is always on and showing Google Calendar&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; view. My wife has her Google Account signed in and only displaying my shared &lt;em&gt;Work&lt;/em&gt; calendar (it only shows busy times). Changes in events are synchronized automatically and are reflected within a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The position of the tablet is on the main floor near the door to the basement. This spot was picked by my wife, as it is a central location during her day. Being able to view the whole day is important as she can better understand my availability and plan her day as well. She is able to see when meetings start/end, and it also captures those impromptu meetings that are made shortly before they begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could you use a different tablet (like an iPad)? Sure thing, I just worked with what I had around the house. This is a perfect way to put an old tablet to good use as the processing specs don&amp;rsquo;t have to be good. One thing to note with the Fire tablets, you have to &lt;a href="https://vidabox.com/blog/2017/02/11/hidden-always-on-setting-for-amazon-fire-tablets/"&gt;enable the &lt;em&gt;Always on&lt;/em&gt; setting&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/07/11/install-play-store-amazon-fire-tablet/"&gt;install the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt; to get Google Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Future Iteration: Indicating in the Basement&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my family is downstairs, there isn&amp;rsquo;t any indication of my availability as my solution is only on the main floor. I&amp;rsquo;d like to replicate the same setup in the basement itself, although I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about simply using a &lt;em&gt;busy light&lt;/em&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The busy light would be on/off to indicate if I&amp;rsquo;m busy. I feel that this solution is better for kids as opposed to the calendar schedule solution, as it clear and binary. I would set up the busy light by using a smart light/plug that can be toggled based on my Google Calendar&amp;rsquo;s event start/end times via &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/"&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description type="html">This is the fourth (and final) installment of a multi-part series on improving your home office. In this article, we talk about the miscellaneous aspects of your home office that I have not covered (lighting, organization, climate, and personalizations).</description>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am writing a multi-part article on the topic of improving your home office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/improve-your-home-office/"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; was mostly a public service announcement to be aware of your home office and to evaluate it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/improve-your-home-office-the-physical-space/"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; explores the physical aspects (e.g., room/space, desk, and chair).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/improve-your-home-office-the-input-output-devices/"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt; explores the input/output aspects (e.g., monitor, keyboard, mouse/trackpad, audio, and video).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 4 (this one) explores the miscellaneous aspects (e.g., lighting, organization, climate, and personalizations).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous parts of this series explored the foundation of your home office, along with the required devices that you need to get work done. We&amp;rsquo;re now at the point where we can consider extra aspects that augment and address new ancillary concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Lighting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural light, while nice to have, is inconsistent in intensity and brightness. Ideally, you should have a decent lighting setup where you don&amp;rsquo;t need to depend on natural lighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a video perspective, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to take extra care to make sure you have proper lighting. There are plenty of resources on how to achieve this, but the main takeaway is to have more light sources (e.g., &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_lighting"&gt;3-point lighting&lt;/a&gt;). To create softer light on your face, you might want to explore putting a light diffuser on your main light source (there are many do-it-yourself options out there, see mine in the picture above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find that your eyes are hurting from looking at your monitor, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to add some &lt;a href="https://powerpractical.com/pages/what-is-tv-bias-lighting"&gt;bias lighting&lt;/a&gt;. There is a very affordable solution in the form of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Luminoodle-USB-Bias-Lighting-Backlight/dp/B076X89GRW"&gt;LED strips you attach behind your monitor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colour and warmth of your lights are also important &amp;ndash; you can go with &lt;em&gt;warmer/yellow&lt;/em&gt; lights for a relaxing feel, or &lt;em&gt;colder/white&lt;/em&gt; lights for a focus feel (read more &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/mind-and-brain/lighting-and-mind-study/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). A nice addition is to use smart light bulbs that allow you to change the colour as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following resources are recommended readings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-smart-led-light-bulbs/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best smart LED light bulbs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-floor-lamps-under-300/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best floor lamps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-led-desk-lamp/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best desk lamps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Climate Control&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking care of your office&amp;rsquo;s environment will result in better productivity. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/08/indoor-carbon-dioxide-levels-could-be-a-health-hazard-scientists-warn"&gt;CO2 and impurities in the air could result in lower cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to monitor these levels, investing in an air purifier if there is little air circulation for your office. If budget is a concern, there are affordable fixes (adding real plants) to improve air quality. Regular cleaning of your workspace will help reduce allergens like dust and pollen (if near a window).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temperature is another factor that can increase/decrease comfort and focus in your workplace. Depending on your space, you might need to invest in a space heater or air conditioning unit. Suffer from cold hands? Check out these interesting solutions &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="https://envavo.com/"&gt;Envavo&lt;/a&gt; desktop heater as well as using sous vide machine (&lt;a href="https://mastery.games/post/warm-coding-hands/"&gt;read more about this unique solution&lt;/a&gt;). Be resourceful, see what works for you and your space and make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in a part of the world where the winter blues hit hard and you are prone to SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder), you might want to try using a light therapy lamp. These lamps are designed to be bright enough (10,000 lux) to simulate daylight earlier in the day to control a shifting circadian rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following resources are recommended readings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-home-air-quality-monitor/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best home air quality monitor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-light-therapy-lamp/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best light therapy lamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Organization&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your workspace&amp;rsquo;s organization can have an impact on your mental state. Disorganization could result in added friction and chaos. Ideally, everything has a &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt; and is generally kept in check. How you organize your workspace depends entirely on what you need and how you do your work. A great strategy is to &lt;em&gt;reset&lt;/em&gt; everything at the end of the day so that you can start fresh the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With many electronic devices, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a power supply to keep them charged and running. You will likely need more than 2-4 electrical outlets, which is where a power bar will be important. It is advisable to not cheap out on this - make sure you have a surge protector on your power bar that is capable of supporting the load. There are nice outlet positions and form-factors, but the end goal is to increase the number of available outlets for your usage. USB hubs are also ideal, as they allow for more connection ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt, cables and wires will run rampant on and around your desk. You can keep this problem in check with proper cable management. There are plenty of ways to do this and there are plenty of unique product solutions out there. I highly recommend taking a look at &lt;a href="https://bluelounge.com/collections/cable-management"&gt;Bluelounge&lt;/a&gt; for comprehensive solutions, or just picking up &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B001E1Y5O6"&gt;velcro fasteners&lt;/a&gt; for a quick way to keep groups of wires together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall cabinets and shelving are great for more storage opportunities, as well as giving you a place to sort and organize important documents. A cabinet is a great way to store less reached for items. I recommend expanding the organization and storage space you have only as you need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following resources are recommended readings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-surge-protector/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best surge protector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-usb-c-hubs-and-docks/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best USB-C hubs and docks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-usb-hubs/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best USB 3.0 hubs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-desktop-organizers/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best desktop organizers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Personalization&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding personal touches to your workspace can be rewarding. If you have the desire to showcase some art or collectables go for it, especially if they bring you joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d highly recommend adding some plants to your home office as there is a &lt;a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/office-design-space/benefits-of-indoor-plants-in-the-office"&gt;lot of research backing the benifits&lt;/a&gt;. If you want a low maintenance plant, succulents are very easy to care for. If you want no maintenance (albeit lower or no benefits), you can get fake plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have specific needs in your home office that require specific tools. You need to address that and make sure you give space and attention to them. For example, if you process a lot of paper, a document scanner and shredder would be good. If you need to draw or whiteboard in digital space, a tablet would be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Constant Improvement&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The home office is a project you can keep chipping away at &amp;ndash; constantly improving it or changing it as your needs change. Working with your space and tools will help you figure what is adding friction or could be improved. Keep an eye on cost as it is easy to run up a large bill when tailoring your office to fit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wraps up the multi-part series on improving your home office. This is a topic that could be written in incredible depth, and I merely scratched the surface. I hope that throughout this you got some new ideas and will be better equipped to work from home in this current situation as well as whatever the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description type="html">This is the third of a multi-part series on improving your home office. In this part, we talk about the input and output aspects of your home office (monitor, mouse/keyboard, audio, and video).</description>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am writing a multi-part article on the topic of improving your home office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/improve-your-home-office/"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; was mostly a public service announcement to be aware of your home office and to evaluate it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/improve-your-home-office-the-physical-space/"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; explores the physical aspects (e.g., room/space, desk, and chair).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 3 (this one) explores the input/output aspects (e.g., monitor, keyboard, mouse/trackpad, audio, and video).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/improve-your-home-office-the-miscellaneous-aspects/"&gt;Part 4&lt;/a&gt; explores the miscellaneous aspects (e.g., lighting, organization, climate, and personalizations).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The input and output devices are the interfaces that exist between you and your workspace. You&amp;rsquo;ll want devices that offer sublime interactions that reduce friction and bring great pleasure to your work. This will make working in your space a joy instead of a burden. This is paramount in collaborative tasks as poor devices can hinder the experience for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Display&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using a laptop, the screen size and location of it relative to your keyboard and yourself play a critical role in ergonomics. You can elevate your laptop&amp;rsquo;s screen to an optimal height using a laptop stand for improved ergonomics. If your space permits it, you can extend your display with an extra monitor or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An extra monitor are wonderful investments for a dedicated home office &amp;ndash; they provide a larger workspace. When purchasing a monitor, make sure it is tailor to your needs. Monitor arms are a great way to minimize monitor footprints and maximize your physical workspace. If your desk supports these it opens up the flexibility to position your monitor at the &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take your display further, make use of multiple monitors. You can get creative with combinations of monitor arms and the position/orientation of your multiple monitors. You could also consider ultrawide monitors &amp;ndash; single unit monitors that offer similar space advantages as multi-monitors without the added bezel separating the monitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following resources are recommended readings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-monitors/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best monitors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-monitor-arms/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best monitor arms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-laptop-stands/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best laptop stands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Audio&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a home office, we&amp;rsquo;ll have to consider both audio input and audio output for effective collaboration. As a default, most people using a laptop will have their built-in speakers and mic on their device. These work in a pinch, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of room for improvement in quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solid upgrade is using a headset as it brings the audio closer to your head. Your voice will sound better as the distance from your mouth to the mic input is closer (even better if you have a headset with a boom arm). This solution will also only broadcast audio out to your ears and not fill your space (preventing feedback and adding privacy). Given the environmental noise in your space, it might be worth looking at the noise-cancelling feature of whatever headset/earbud you decide to go with. A wireless headset is a great option if you value mobility and less clutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your personal preference, a good headset can support all your audio listening needs. There are some high-quality headsets out there that provide immersive and great sound quality for music. Alternatively, using external computer speakers that sit on your desk can be an attractive solution for an experience that fills your space with rich and deep sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for that professional podcasting audio sound you should look at an external USB microphone. These offer great input capture and offer much more customization and tweaking if you decide to explore that route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the minimum, you should probably get a headset to conduct meetings. Going for more elaborate setups and devices in this space really depends on your taste and desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following resources are recommended readings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-wireless-headset-for-the-office/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best wireless headset for the office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-headphones/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best noise cancelling headphones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-usb-microphone/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best USB microphone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-computer-speakers/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best computer speakers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Webcam&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A visual presence in collaborative meetings is a must-have in any remote working environment. Being to see each other gives meetings more of a &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; feel and allows each side to see facial expressions and body language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most laptops these days have a built-in webcam that is sufficient. There are two caveats with the built-in solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The angle and position of the webcam is tied to your laptop itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The video quality is lacklustre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dedicated high-quality webcam rectifies these two issues. It can be moved to optimal positions and the picture quality is far superior. If you wanted to go the extra mile, you can look at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21244380/webcam-camera-how-to-dslr-mirrorless-capture-card-usb-hdmi"&gt;using a DSLR or mirrorless camera as a webcam&lt;/a&gt;. This is a much more expensive route, but the video quality is the best you can get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Keyboard&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d argue that the keyboard is the most used device you have. As with most things related to home offices, there is a lot of personal preference when it comes to keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a strong &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/"&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; for mechanical keyboards that offer near unlimited customization options. To start with, you can vary the size, keycaps, and key switches to fit your style. These customizations create unique typing experiences that can be more enjoyable and ergonomic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a large space for ergonomic keyboards &amp;ndash; defined by their unorthodox physical layout. For example, the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-ca/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/l5v-00002"&gt;Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop&lt;/a&gt; has a defined split and curved design. Most ergonomic keyboards fall under the mechanical keyboard umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you value a clean work surface a wireless keyboard is a nice way to minimize wire clutter. It is worth noting that oftentimes the higher-end mechanical keyboards require a wired connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following resources are recommended readings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s our favorite mechanical keyboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/comfortable-ergo-keyboard/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best ergonomic keyboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-bluetooth-keyboard/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best bluetooth keyboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Mouse&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mouse is the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6rKUf9DWRI"&gt;original pointing input device&lt;/a&gt; and has been a staple for all personal computing since its inception. For most people, the mouse covers all their needs. Like previous suggestions, a wireless device provides a clean solution on a desk. The &lt;a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/product/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse"&gt;vertical mouse&lt;/a&gt; is a more ergonomic variant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trackball mouse is an ergonomic departure from a traditional mouse in the sense that you move your cursor by spinning a ball on a fixed mouse. The idea is that you reduce arm motion and you an keep your hand and arm in an ergonomic position. If desk space and/or ergonomics are a concern, this type of mouse might be a good solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people are familiar with trackpads &amp;ndash; almost, if not every, laptop comes with one. Using an external trackpad occupies less space than a mouse and is usually wireless. You gain access to gestures based on your operating system, and using them feels fairly intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor ergonomics can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355603"&gt;carpal tunnel syndrome&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; if needed, switch up your device to relieve the discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following resources are recommended readings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-wireless-mouse/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best wireless mouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-gaming-mouse/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best wired gaming mouse mouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-trackballs/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best trackballs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Powerful Subtle Interfaces&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interactions between yourself and a computer are driven entirely through input and output devices. Ergonomics is key, especially for prolonged use. Having a good set of devices allows you to focus more on your work with less hindrance. Pay attention to the purchasing cost of devices as there are diminishing returns with expensive products.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description type="html">This is the second of a multi-part series on improving your home office. In this part, we talk about the physical aspects of your home office (space, desk, and chair).</description>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am writing a multi-part article on the topic of improving your home office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/improve-your-home-office/"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; was mostly a public service announcement to be aware of your home office and to evaluate it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 2 (this one) explores the physical aspects (e.g., room/space, desk, and chair).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/improve-your-home-office-the-input-output-devices"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt; explores the input/output aspects (e.g., monitor, keyboard, mouse/trackpad, audio, and video).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/improve-your-home-office-the-miscellaneous-aspects/"&gt;Part 4&lt;/a&gt; explores the miscellaneous aspects (e.g., lighting, organization, climate, and personalizations).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical space is the foundation on which the rest is built. Without a good location for your home office, it can be hard to get &lt;em&gt;deep work&lt;/em&gt; done. The following dissects aspects of the physical space of a home office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Space&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A home office is a place to focus and work, thus it is paramount to keep external distractions at bay. The space that you use for your home office will contribute greatly to how productive you might be. Having your office in a common area (e.g., living room) is pretty much fighting a losing battle if you live with other people (family/friends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If space allows it, I highly recommend placing your home office in its own dedicated room. If that isn&amp;rsquo;t possible, the next best place would be a shared space with minimal traffic. A dedicated office space creates boundaries. When your space&amp;rsquo;s functionality and location bleed into other areas, it can blur the line between work and home time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When deciding where your home office should be, there are various environmental factors to take into account:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being in a basement might limit natural light and the ability to get fresh air, and also prove noisy from the activity above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being near a window (which you want to open occasionally) or other noisy space can be distracting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being near a window can also introduce annoying glare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being aware of air/heat circulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware of the size of your space. Opt for a location where you can have a decent space for working, along with some space to store/place miscellaneous items. Having the extra room gives you some freedom in how to structure your space, and can open some customization opportunities (e.g., fitness equipment, whiteboard, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Desk&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your desk is something that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to skimp on if possible. If you are planning to use the home office long term, I would avoid the following: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I just use my countertop or kitchen table. I just sit on the couch and use my lap&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. If you spend long periods of time working in your home office then ergonomics and a dedicated surface are key. Once you decide on your space, I would try to maximize the surface size of your desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of desk options out there, and it really boils down to what works for you and your space:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A desk with built-in drawers and/or a hutch for extra storage space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A desk that supports clamps for monitor arms (i.e., good thickness/strength and an open back).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A desk that has an ergonomic bezel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A desk that can support a lot of weight if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A desk that is esthetically pleasing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A standing desk (fixed or adjustable) to avoid sitting all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An L-shaped desk for corner offices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a standard desk and are looking to explore the sit/stand or stand options, you could take a look at &lt;em&gt;Standing Desk Converters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following resources are recommended readings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-standing-desk/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best standing desks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-standing-desk-converters/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best standing desk converters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Chair&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are working at a desk then you will likely spend many hours sitting on a chair (unless you have a standing desk). A basic wooden chair works in a pinch, but for the long term, you&amp;rsquo;ll want a chair that offers more adjustability and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like the desk, there are plenty of options available, most of it comes down to personal preference. For that reason, I highly recommend going with a chair that you can sit in before purchasing. The following are some factors to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chair with casters to move around easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chair that has adjustable or removable features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chair that is breathable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chair that is comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneeling_chair"&gt;kneeling chair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.uncagedergonomics.com/blog/what-is-an-active-chair/"&gt;active wobble chair&lt;/a&gt; or yoga ball&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other thing to consider is a standing desk mat if you decide on the standing desk route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following resource is a recommended reading:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-office-chair/"&gt;Wirecutter&amp;rsquo;s best office chairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Lay the Foundation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take care to pick the right physical space for your home office as it is the foundation upon which everything else is built. The right desk and chair will have to fit within that space comfortably. You can tailor your space to maximize productivity and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
