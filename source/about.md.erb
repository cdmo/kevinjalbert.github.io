# About Me

## Personally

I'm a husband, father, and a Software Engineer living in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). This website will primarily be a software development blog, with some possible off-topic entries sprinkled throughtout.

In the past I was an avid gamer, although in recent years I have less time to indulge. I still enjoy following and playing the occasional game. I do enjoy some [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/) (although I'm pretty bad at it) and I have a fascination with idle games for some strange reason.

## Professionally

I finished my Bachlor's in Software Engineer at the [University of Ontario Institue of Technology (UOIT)](https://uoit.ca/). I had took an interest in research and continued on with a Master's in Computer Science. For my research I mostly focused on software quality and mutation testing.

I am currently working at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.ca/about). I primarily work in Ruby (Rails) and JavaScript (React), although if I had to pick a language to quickly do something it would be in Ruby.
