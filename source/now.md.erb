# What am I Focusing on Now?

Everything below is a high-level snapshot of what I'm working on as of <%= File.open(current_page.source_file).mtime.strftime('%B %e, %Y') %>.

## Personal
- Likely working on the next blog article. I have been doing one post a month since January 2016.
- Enjoying family time with my wife and son (born November 2016).
- Better organizing my life using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).

## Professional
- Refining my technical skills (Ruby/Rails, JavaScript/React).
- Refining my leadership skills.
- Understanding my new job and role at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.ca/about) to better make an impact.
