# My Setup

Everything below is what I am using in my day-to-day, as of <%= File.open(current_page.source_file).mtime.strftime('%B %e, %Y') %>.

For more details on this concept I recommend looking over [awesome-uses](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/).

## Devices

- [MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018)](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP776)
  - 512 GB Storage
  - 16 GB Memory
  - 2.2 GHz i7
  - Radeon Pro 555X

- [OnePlus 6T](https://www.oneplus.com/6t)
  - 128 GB Storage
  - 8 GB Memory

## Editor + Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my main driver when I'm editing for a while (i.e., project-based work). For the configuration you can take a look at my [cloudSettings gist](https://gist.github.com/kevinjalbert/9b7531b9a727156fd1bc01d243d58390) that I keep updated via the [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) extension.
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) for when I want to quickly editing when I'm bouncing around in terminal. For the configuration you can take a look at my [dotfiles for neovim](https://github.com/kevinjalbert/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/nvim).
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for my terminal.
- [Zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) for my shell. For the configurations you can look at my [.zshrc](https://github.com/kevinjalbert/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc) and [.zaliases](https://github.com/kevinjalbert/dotfiles/blob/master/.zaliases) files.
- [Tomorrow Night](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme#tomorrow-night) as my colour scheme where I can get it to work.
- [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for my font choice (has nice ligatures).
