# My Setup

Everything below is what I am using in my day-to-day, as of <%= File.open(current_page.source_file).mtime.strftime('%B %e, %Y') %>.

For more details on this concept, I recommend looking over [awesome-uses](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/).

## Editor + Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my main driver when I'm editing for a while (i.e., project-based work). For the configuration, you can take a look at my [cloudSettings gist](https://gist.github.com/kevinjalbert/9b7531b9a727156fd1bc01d243d58390) that I keep updated via the [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) extension.
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) for when I want to quickly edit when I'm bouncing around in the terminal. For the configuration, you can take a look at my [dotfiles for neovim](https://github.com/kevinjalbert/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/nvim).
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for my terminal.
- [Zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) for my shell. For the configurations, you can look at my [.zshrc](https://github.com/kevinjalbert/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc) and [.zaliases](https://github.com/kevinjalbert/dotfiles/blob/master/.zaliases) files.
- [Tomorrow Night](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme#tomorrow-night) as my colour scheme where I can get it to work.
- [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for my font choice (has nice ligatures).

## Desk/Workspace
- [Rain Design mStand Laptop Stand](https://amzn.to/2Wm74sa) is a solid laptop stand and raises my laptop up to the perfect level.
- [LG 27" 4K UHD IPS Monitor](https://amzn.to/2CBqbag) is an amazing monitor due to its size and resolution. I've also gone and attached a [Luminoodle LED TV Backlight Strip](https://amzn.to/2Uc79RW) to reduce eye strain.

## Personal Gear
- [Timbuk2 Spire Backpack](https://amzn.to/2WkUKbV) expands and contracts to accommodate its contents. There is a protective laptop holder that fits the 15" MacBook Pro. I rarely worry about weather conditions with this backpack.
- [Victorinox Swiss Army Cadet Knife](https://amzn.to/2HOrFRY) is a trusty companion that I keep attached to my keychain, it has proved its usefulness time and time again.
- [Doxie Go](https://amzn.to/2HPU8Hf) quick and easy way to digitize paper.
