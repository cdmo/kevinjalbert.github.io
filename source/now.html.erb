As of <%= File.open(current_page.source_file).mtime.strftime('%B %e, %Y') %> this is a subset of what I am currently working on:

<ul>
  <li>Working on the next blog article I am aiming for one post a month</li>
  <li>Enjoying time with my new son -- born Nov 2016</li>
  <li>Refining my Javascript and React skills</li>
  <li>Learning and using GraphQL with Apollo</li>
</ul>
