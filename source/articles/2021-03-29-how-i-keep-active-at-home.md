At this point in my life, I live a pretty sedentary lifestyle. I've been working remotely for just over two years and so I've lost the *walk* my old commute would provide me. The commute walk amounted to about 30 minutes of brisk walking each day. I'm not one to go to a gym for a workout, and I'm satisfied with at-home exercises. I have two young kids and it can be challenging to find time to exercise.

I picked up an inexpensive folding [exercise bike](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B007595TKU) to keep in my office a few years back to help with at-home exercising (cardio). I didn't use it all that much until I started working remotely. The bike helped keep my Apple Watch *rings* happy.

I had also discovered the joy of playing video games while cycling. As the exercise bike was light enough, I could drag it outside my office to where the video game consoles were. I also would sometimes just raise my desk into its standing position and play something on Steam.

I mostly play Action/Adventure and RPG games and these tend to work out well for me while cycling. Playing video games while biking can be a bit challenging at times, depending on what the game's task is. I sometimes find myself slowing down for *tricky* platforming, even completely stopping to complete a difficult boss battle.

In addition to playing video games, I will mix it up by watching videos. I generally stay to YouTube in which I'll watch some videos on technical content (i.e., conference talks), or videos on random stuff. I have, on occasion, exercised through a movie, however that usually means splitting the *movie experience* over multiple sessions.

I normally end up doing 30-45 minutes of cycling a day (depending on how sad my Apple rings are at the end of the day) while watching/playing something, and it is enough to work up a bit of sweat. I aim to keep my pace within a set range - nothing too intense, just enough to get the heart pumping faster than normal.

I recently purchased a [treadmill](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B08423CNCR) as well that I've tried gaming with. I personally found it much harder than being on a stationary bicycle. You cannot easily slow down for those *harder* moments in a game (think flying off the back of the treadmill), and I found that my stride was a lot more clumsy. Watching a video while on a treadmill is better though, as you don't have to work the controller and perform input commands.

This approach works for me and allows me to combine two things together - I can exercise and play at the same time.

**TL;DR:** If you're not one to exercise but you like to play games or watch shows/movies, make it a point to not sit still. Get a stationary bike, an inexpensive treadmill, or other types of exercise equipment and bundle what you want to do with physical activity.
