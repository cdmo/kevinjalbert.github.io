I'm keeping this post fairly short due to the holiday season (I also just moved houses at the end of November, so it has been a bit hectic the last month). This post can be seen more as an informative tip for gamers who use [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), which they might not know about.

## Steam Remote Play

If you do any form of PC gaming, you likely know about Steam. It's a great service that has been around for a while. Fun fact -- I found out that my Steam account is 17 years old! Steam has a wide selection of games, and over the years many new features have been added. I want to talk about one such feature -- [Steam Remote Play](https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay).

Steam Remote Play blew my mind when I first tried it out. It lets you stream a game from a  system running Steam to a compatible client (e.g., an iPhone/iPad, Apple TV, etc.). The inputs and outputs work seamlessly and you are able to fully experience the game without being confined to where your gaming PC is located.

I personally use the [Steam Link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steam-link/id1246969117) app on my iPhone and Apple TV. Apple's ecosystem can use Bluetooth controllers (e.g., Xbox Controller) as an input, so this allows me to play games from a comfy couch like a console gamer. For those times that I need a keyboard or mouse, Steam Remote Play can also stream to another Steam Desktop client on my MacBook.

## Tips

The following are a couple of tips that I've found useful during my time using Steam Remote Play.

### Wired Network Connection

The best thing you can do to improve your experience with Steam Remote Play is a strong LAN connection between the gaming PC and the clients you want to play on. A bad network connection increases input lag and graphical artifacts (pixelated look). It took a bit of work, but I was able to get a direct-wired ethernet connection from my router between my Apple TV and my gaming PC. The connection is such that I can't tell whether I'm streaming or playing locally.

### Wake-on-LAN

I didn't want to keep my gaming PC on all the time from a power consumption perspective. I only use it when I want to play games, however, it resides in another room different from where I'm playing.

I take advantage of [_Wake-on-LAN_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/wake-on-lan-feature) in Windows. This allows the Steam Link app to send a _wake-up_ packet when it tries to connect to the gaming PC, which powers on the PC for me on-demand. The finishing touch here is that I set a 10 minute [sleep timer in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-adjust-power-and-sleep-settings-in-windows-26f623b5-4fcc-4194-863d-b824e5ea7679), which makes it so when you exit a game and stop streaming the PC will go to sleep.

### Non-Steam Games

I also found out you can add [Non-Steam games](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4B8B-9697-2338-40EC), which still work via Steam Remote Play. This opens up a lot of opportunities as Steam is essentially opening/closing an executable. You could have games from another store (e.g., [Epic Games](https://www.[epicgames.com/store)), stand-alone games, or even ROMs if you are into that (via [Steam ROM Manager](https://steamgriddb.github.io/steam-rom-manager/)).

### Dedicated Controller

The whole point of this setup is to increase comfort when playing games by not being tied to a desk (assuming the game can be played with a controller). Having a dedicated controller just lowers the friction of _getting into a game_. With my Apple TV setup, I just turn the Xbox Controller and Apple TV on, start up Steam Link and I'm playing within a minute or less.
